1. Creation of temporary array and dictionary to store the elements as well as the frequency
2. Loop through the elements in the temporary array and add the elements to the dictionary as indices to obtain unique 
   values and intialise the values to 0

3. Loop through the elements in the temporary array and increment the values of the keys corresponding to the elements
   in the array, this way for every repetition of the elements in the temporary array the value to corresponding key is increased
   by 1 in the dictionary

4. Finally loop through dictionary to display the key value pairs as per requirement. 
   Here,
   keys of the dictionary:-  are given unique element in the provided temporaryArray
   values of the dictionary:- are the frequencies of the repeated elements in the provided temporaryArray

5. The output is provided in the form of a string, "$element is repeated ${temporaryDict[$element]} times"
