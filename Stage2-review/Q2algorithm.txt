1. Declare a dictionary to store the computations (computeDictionary)

2. For UC1, take user input three times and assign them to variables a,b and c

3. For UC2, UC3, UC4 and UC5, go through the computations and assign them to their respective variables 
   and display the results

4. For UC6, store the results in a Dictionary for every Computation and display the results, both the keys and values

5. For UC7, loop through the dictionary and read the values into an array (computeArray) and display the array

6. For UC8, sort the values in the array in descending order and assign them to a new array (arrayDescending)

7. Display the descending ordered array (arrayDescending)

8. For UC9, sort the values in the array in ascending order and assign them to a new array (arrayAscending)

9. Display the ascending ordered array (arrayAscending)
