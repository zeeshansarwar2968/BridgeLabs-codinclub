Executable program:

for item in `ls`
do
	folder=`echo $item | awk -F. '{ print $1 }'`
	subfolder=`echo $item | awk -F. '{ print $2 }'`
	mkdir -p $folder/$subfolder
	mv $item $folder/$subfolder
done

Logic behind the above program:

1. First we iterate through all the listed files in the folder using a for loop

2. Now while inside the loop we create two variables, namely folder and subfolder

3. We assign the name of the file to folder and extension of the file to subfolder

3. Post the last step we move on to creating the nested directory

4. Here "folder" is the parent directory with "subfolder" being the child/nested 
   directory in the format "folder/subfolder"

5. Finally we move the file into the created nested directory 'subfolder' with -mv- command,
   since we want to cut and paste into the subfolder

6. This loop is run for all the files in the directory, thereby creating 
   nested folders for all the files.
